clients:
  # name: the name of the client, cannot be null
  - name: example_user1
    # id: the password(uuid) of each user, this can either be a string or an UUID. Please read the "comment" and "IMPORTANT" sections.
    # default: auto-generated random string
    # comment: for a managed environment we recommend hardcoding the id
    #          the generated id does NOT currently back-propagate to this file 
    #          you WILL lose existing users if you run configure.py multiple times with blank ids as they will be regenerated with random ids
    #
    # ! IMPORTANT !: id DOES NOT have to be UUID, can be any string of length 1-30. This is supported by xray but not by some v2ray clients
    #                if the script detects that id is not a valid UUID, it will also output the equivalent UUID of that string
    id: 
    # flow: the flow parameter of each user
    # default: xtls-rprx-direct
    flow:
    # port: local socks5 proxy port on clients' machines

    port: 
  # you can also set each field manually like below:
  - name: example_user2
    id: example_passwd2
